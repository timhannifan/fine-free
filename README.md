# fine-free

### About
Stree parking spots are often inaccessible on an ad-hoc basis due to residential permits, construction, street cleaning, snow removal, parades and festivals, police activity, fallen trees, movie permitting, and other reasons. Street parking is a veritable fine minefield in cities around the world.

Although some cities publish lists of street parking closures, they usually do not cover these types of temporary and unexpected events. This app provides a way for people to report local parking information, and access real-time updates for their current location anywhere in the world.
