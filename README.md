# fine-free

### About
Street parking is often inaccessible due to residential permitting, construction, street cleaning, snow removal, parades and festivals, police activity, fallen trees, movie permitting, and other reasons. Street parking is a veritable fine-minefield in cities around the world.

Although some cities publish lists of street parking closures, they usually do not cover these types of temporary and unexpected events. This app provides a way for people to report local parking information, and access real-time updates for their current location anywhere in the world.
